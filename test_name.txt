Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. This involves various tasks such as speech recognition, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more. As technology advances, NLP continues to evolve, offering new and improved ways for machines to comprehend and respond to human language.
